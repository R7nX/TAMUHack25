BofA Securities advises investors to stay the course but joined a chorus of Wall Street voices expressing concern over flagging iPhone demand. The iPhone is by far Appleâ€™s most important product as it brings in the most revenue. Any drop in iPhone sales is a concern for investors. Wamsi Mohan lowered his price target on Apple shares to $253 from $256 on Friday, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. Shares were down 0.6% to $222 in afternoon trading. The stock gained 16% over the past 12 months, is down 11% in January. Mohan wrote that he expects weaker iPhone demand and a prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features to affect sales in the current quarter."
